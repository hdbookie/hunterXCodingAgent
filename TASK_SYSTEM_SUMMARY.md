# Task Management System for Coding Agent

## What We Added

The coding agent now includes a simple task management system that helps break down complex projects into manageable steps. This makes the agent more organized and transparent about its progress.

## New Functions

### Core Task Functions
```python
def create_task(description: str, priority: str = "medium") -> str:
    """Create a new task with description and priority."""

def list_tasks() -> str:
    """List all tasks with their current status."""

def complete_task(task_id: str) -> str:
    """Mark a task as completed."""

def update_task(task_id: str, status: str) -> str:
    """Update task status (pending/in_progress/completed)."""
```

### Available Statuses
- `pending` - Task created but not started
- `in_progress` - Currently working on task
- `completed` - Task finished

## How It Works

1. **Task Creation**: Agent creates tasks to break down complex goals
2. **Progress Tracking**: Uses `list_tasks()` to see current status
3. **Status Updates**: Marks tasks as completed or updates progress
4. **Visual Feedback**: Shows ‚òê for pending, üîÑ for in progress, ‚úÖ for completed

## Example Usage

When given a complex goal like "Create a web scraper", the agent now:

1. Creates tasks for each major step
2. Works through them systematically
3. Tracks progress visually
4. Provides better transparency

## Implementation Details

- **In-memory storage**: Tasks reset each run (keeps it simple)
- **Global task counter**: Auto-incrementing IDs
- **Priority support**: Optional priority levels
- **Error handling**: Validates task IDs and statuses

## Benefits

- **Better organization** for complex projects
- **Transparency** into agent's planning process
- **Progress tracking** for multi-step tasks
- **Simple implementation** suitable for educational demos

This addition makes the agent more capable of handling real-world coding projects that require multiple coordinated steps.
